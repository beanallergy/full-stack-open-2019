```
npm run server
```

```
npm start
```

Note: [json-server custom routes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server#add-custom-routes) is used so that baseUrl in `src/services/persons.js` doesn't need to be changed for [part 3](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/deploying_app_to_internet#frontend-production-build) (full-stack phonebook app)
